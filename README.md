# heart-disease-project
Created a ML model for heart disease binary classification.

## Data information in CSV

* Column Descriptions:
* Id (Unique id for each patient)
* Age (Age of the patient in years)
* Origin (place of study)
* Sex (Male/Female)
* Cp chest pain type ([typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal, asymptomatic])
* Trestbps resting blood pressure (resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital))
* Chol (serum cholesterol in mg/dl)
* Fbs (if fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)
* Restecg (resting electrocardiographic results)
* â€“ Values: [normal, stt abnormality, lv hypertrophy]
* Thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
* Exang: exercise-induced angina (True/ False)
* Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
* Thal: [normal; fixed defect; reversible defect]
* Num: the predicted attribute
